# First Look: Siri Shortcuts

### Introduction

The common impression is that Siri does not compare with Alexa and Google Voice.  Siri seems stuck in the past compared to its rivals.  Voice assistants are OK for general information like Wikipedia or weather or sports, but they lag when it comes to *personal* information.  

WWDC 2018, with one of the most enthusiastic presenters in memory, changes all that.

### 25 Extensions and Counting

Every year Apple comes up with new ways for apps to integrate themselves within the operating system.  There are now 25 different extensions you can add to an app to keep it from getting marooned on the home screen.  From Spotlight search, to Apple Watch extensions, to local notifications.  Over the last couple of years, Apple has gradually opened up Siri to developers.  At first the list of voice intents was quite restrictive.  Now apps can generate custom intents to handle just about any kind of user interaction.

### A Problem Never Solved Well by Notifications

Until now, the best way to interact with users outside the app was

This is part of the ongoing effort to keep apps from getting marooned on the home screen.  The challenge is to integrate application functionality into the operating system of the device.  Siri shortcuts offer

### User Activity

One new feature is suggested activities via Siri Shortcuts. 
These shortcuts are presented to the user at a time the system considers to be relevant, or when the user searches for a keyword in spotlight search.
In our banking app, we created a shortcut for accessing a user's checking account. When the user completes the action normally by visiting their Checking Account Details view, the app 
creates an NSUserActivity which defines the action, and donates it to the system. Donations like these are tracked internally on the device, and used to suggest the shortcut to the user at an appropriate time.
For example, if a customer of your bank is constantly revisiting their checking account balance at noon every other Friday, Siri and the system will learn this behavior and suggest the action to the user on subsequent Fridays via the lock screen.
Alternatively, if the user searches in spotlight for the phrase or keywords associated with the NSUserActivity, a suggestion will appear in the search results that will navigate the user to the appropriate screen. A screenshot of this functionality is below.

You will have to implement the AppDelegate function `application(_ application: continue userActivity: restorationHandler: ) -> Bool` to handle the user selecting those shortcuts.


### Conclusion and Recommendations

You can implment it now.  By Christmas 2018, enterprises can expect that 70% of their customers will be running iOS 12.  A year from now, that percentage will be close to 90%.  With the `@Available` tag, our customers can deploy code that

It may take a year to get your intents up to speed.

There is no reason why you can’t build it in now for the fall.
